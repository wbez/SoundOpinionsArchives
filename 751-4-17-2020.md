Back in the {genre: 1950s}, artists like {artist: Little Richard} and {artist: Liberace} found unique ways to present their sexuality within the "acceptable" boundaries existing in society, and in many ways, pushed them. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have a discussion about {tag: sexuality} in music. They also review new albums by {genre: pop} artist {artist: Dua Lipa} and {genre: indie} acts {artist: Waxahatchee} and {artist: Melkbelly}.


## 00:01:00 Review: Dua Lipa

{place: Albanian}-born and {place: English}-bred {genre: pop} artist {artist: Dua Lipa} hopes to slay the {tag: sophomore slump} with her latest album, {album: Future Nostalgia}. According to Greg, all the ingredients are there, including a solid stable of producers like {artist: Jeff Bhasker} and {artist: Stuart Price}. It's also chock full of sonic references to an "entire era" of classic {genre: dance music} of the {era: 1970s} and {era: 1980s} by artists like {artist: Madonna}. He adds that she is a "canny songwriter" with the ability to "weave together that pop sugar atop those relentless {genre: disco} beats." Greg thinks the record falls short however, at the end with the track "{track: Good In Bed}," a song he says "may be one of the worst songs in the English language in the last year. A truly annoying piece of music." Jim agrees with Greg's take on "Good In Bed", but thinks that the whole album falls short, adding that "this is the worst kind of superficial pop music, in that if you are not actually listening to it… it seems pleasant enough…" But, Jim concludes that "this is bad."

## 00:08:04 Review: {artist: Waxahatchee}

{name: Katie Cruchfield}'s musical identity is named after a creek near where she grew up in Alabama. Greg sees {album: Saint Cloud}, her fifth album, as a return to considering the area where she grew up and embracing a "warmer sound" in the tradition of {genre: Americana} singers like {artist: Lucinda Williams}. Crutchfield credits her recent sobriety with a new sense of clarity, which Greg and Jim both appreciate. They agree the song's centerpiece is the song "{track: Arkadelphia}," with it's keen eye for novelistic details. Jim's one request would be for another voice to interact with Crutchfield's over the course of the album. 


## 00:15:19 Review: Melkbelly

On the {place: Chicago} quartet's second album, {album: Pith}, their noise meets pop-punk approach is refined to a degree that makes both Jim and Greg very excited. Greg is confident the album will be on his year-end top ten list and declares {artist: Melkbelly} is one of the best bands working today. Jim sees touchs of shoegaze and {artist: Veruca Salt} in the combination of pop vocal melodies with ferocious noise. He says the album title is apt considering lyrics like, "Stop introducing yourself as just a girlfriend because it's twee and unneccessary." Their live show is well-known, so quarantine can't end soon enough.

Stephens}, author of the book Rocking the Closet: How Little Richard, {artist: Johnnie Ray}, Liberace and {artist: Johnny Mathis} Queered {genre: Pop} Music.
