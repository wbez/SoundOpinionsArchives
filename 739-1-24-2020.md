This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review the new release from {genre: indie} {genre: singer-songwriter} {artist: Torres}. {album: Silver Tongue} is Torres's fourth album, but she's no stranger to Sound Opinions, having been [a guest on the show back in 2015](https://www.soundopinions.org/show/501/). Greg loves this album and how Torres blends synths with finger picking guitar. She also ups the hook quotient in her writing, making for a great record. Jim agrees, and loves Torres's literary, lyrical tone. They both find her genuine and transparent songs to be refreshing and enjoyable.


## 00:42:01 Review: Drive-By Truckers

{artist: Drive-By Truckers} have been at it since 1998, but on their 12th studio album, {album: The Unraveling}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree they've found something new to say. Coming three and a half years after their "most political album," 2016's {album: American Band}, {album: The Unraveling} goes all-in on topical songwriting in a way the Truckers have never attempted before. Jim says the effort works because songwriters {name: Patterson Hood} and {name: Mike Cooley} focus first on the victims of the current political climate and let that animate their writing. Greg points out a sub-group of songs that focus on characters who feel like they're fugitives in their own country: "{track: Rosemary with a Bible and a Gun}," "{track: Armageddon's Back in Town}" and "{track: Slow Ride Argument}." Jim calls "{track: Thoughts and Prayers}" an earworm with an insideous hook.
