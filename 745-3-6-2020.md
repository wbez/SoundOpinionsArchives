## 00:01:00 Review: Tame Impala
![grimes](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2020/slow.jpg)
The {place: Australia}n {genre: psychedelic rock} band {artist: Tame Impala} return with their first new album in five years, {album: The Slow Rush}. Led by {artist: Kevin Parker}, the band has experienced mainstream and critical success. However, neither {host: Jim} nor {host: Greg} find this album very good. Greg asserts that he finds the arrangements to be sonically beautiful and deep, but beyond that, there isn't much. Despite also liking the band's music, Jim can't find anything positive to say about The Slow Rush.


## 00:07:30 Review: Grimes

{genre: Electronic} {genre: art pop} artist {artist: Grimes} is back with her latest album, {album: Miss Anthropocene}. It's her first record in five years since 2015's {album: Art Angels}. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are big fans of Grimes and really enjoy the layered complexities of Miss Anthropocene. Jim loves the epic sonic landscapes Grimes creates, and also when she throws listeners for a loop by adding in more conventional instruments like acoustic guitar. He loves the artistic concept of the album, about a goddess warrior who defends the earth from climate change. Greg is also on board with Miss Anthropocene and agrees with Jim that it rewards fans who listen multiple times. He loves the way she writes, sings, composes and produces her own records, and the fact that he never knows what she'll make next.

![grimes](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2020/mazzy.jpg)
 Greg pays tribute to {artist: David Roback} of {artist: Mazzy Star} and The Rain Parade, who died of cancer on February 24th. He was 61. The writer, producer and guitarist was, according to Greg, a co-founder of a number of "star-crossed" bands that never quite reached the peak of fame, including {artist: Opal} and {genre: Paisley Underground} foundational band {artist: The Rain Parade}. Opal eventually became Mazzy Star with the addition of {artist: Hope Sandoval}. That group stopped releasing music in the mid 1990s. Yet, he maintains that "in the span of what seemed like six years in the late {era: 1980s} and early {era: 1990s} he was in three really influential bands."
