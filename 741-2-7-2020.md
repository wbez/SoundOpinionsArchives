{artist: King Crimson} is a legendary {genre: progressive rock} band that has evolved through the decades in innovative, and sometimes surprising ways. This week, {host: Greg} and {host: Jim} explore the constant evolution of the classic band that refuses to rest on its laurels. Plus, Jim and Greg pay tribute to {artist: Gang of Four} guitarist {artist: Andy Gill}, dead at the age of 64.

## 00:01:01  Special: King Crimson
{artist: King Crimson} is a classic band that consistently rejects nostalgia. On this week's show, Jim and Greg highlight three distinct periods of innovation in their decades long career and highlight three key albums: {era: 1969}'s {album: Court of the Crimson King} (an early {genre: prog rock} classic), {era: 1974}'s {album: Red} (a {genre: proto-metal} album that's only grown in reputation over the years), and {era: 1981}'s {album: Discipline} (a {genre: new wave}/{genre: experimental} record on par with work by then-contemporaries like the {artist: Talking Heads}). Three distinctive sounds from one band with only one constant member: founding guitarist {tag: Robert Fripp}.

This week we pay tribute to the only constant member of {artist: Gang of Four}: guitarist {artist: Andy Gill} (no relation to Sound Opinions producer Andrew Gill.) He died February 1 at age 64. A band spokesperson said he succumbed to pneumonia. 

The {genre: post-punk} innovator was known for being an "anti-lead guitarist," eschewing traditional solos and instead approaching the instrument as a noise machine. When he and Gang of Four vocalist Jon King were [on Sound Opinions in 2011](https://www.soundopinions.org/show/274/#andygill), Gill said, "There's enough noodling in the world, there's enough guitar solos. The noise thing is inherently more interesting." 

After Gang of Four reunited in 2004, Gill kept the group going even after King's eventual departure in 2011, touring through November 2019 and releasing the album "Happy Now" last year.

Jim and Greg agree Gill's legacy will live on through countless bands who were influenced by his musical style and [inspired by his political activism](https://www.soundopinions.org/show/728/#gangoffour).
