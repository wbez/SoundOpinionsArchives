- Janet: "Who is your favorite musician/band and how do they inspire you?"

## 00:38:41 Review: Wire
![Wire Mind Hive](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2020/wire.png)
On their 17th album, {album: Mind Hive}. the British {genre: art punks} of {artist: Wire} are still re-imagining their sound. The group's first three albums from the {era: late 1970s} are widely considered classics: {album: Pink Flag}, {album: Chairs Missing}, and {album: 1 5 4}. Each fleshed out a different sonic approach ("pure punk minimalist attack, expanding sound and full on syth pop," respectively according to {host: Jim DeRogatis}). Since then Wire has been taking apart those elements and reassembling them in different ways. Now {host: Jim} hears them nodding to groups that were influenced by those early albums like {artist: The Feelies}. {host: Greg} says if {name: Samuel Beckett} were a band, he would be these guys, dryly narrating the end of the world. 

## 00:46:50 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg} drops another coin into the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, this time highlighting a recently unearthed {tag: demo} recording by {artist: Prince}. "{track: Can't Stop This Feeling I Got}" was originally released on the {album: Graffiti Bridge} soundtrack album in 1990. The demo recording, which is full of upbeat, {genre: new wave} energy, was recorded years earlier, then shelved. It was released for the first time in 2019 for the Super Deluxe Edition of the classic album {album: 1999}. Greg notes that Prince plays every instrument on the demo which was recorded at his home studio, and adds that "most artists would be happy to have a catalogue" with only the 35 shelved cuts that comprise the bonus tracks of the box set.
