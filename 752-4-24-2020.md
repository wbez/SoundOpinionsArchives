## 00:36:45 Interview: Sudan Archives 



This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk with singer and violinist {artist: Sudan Archives}. This was the last in-person interview they did before everything shut down due to the coronavirus, and they were glad as both of them are big fans of {album: Athena}, Sudan Archives's debut album. In addition to a live performance, they talk about her blend of influences ranging from {genre: celtic fiddle} to {genre: electronic} music, her {genre: pop} music past and how she got her unique name.
