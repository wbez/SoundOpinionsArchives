![best](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2020/rev_roundup_2.png)

While a lot of the world is at a standstill, new albums are still coming out. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review the new records from {artist: Fiona Apple}, {artist: The Weeknd}, {artist: The Strokes} and more. They also hear from the {tag: Boston Red Sox}'s organist about how {tag: COVID-19} has impacted his work and what he's doing to lift baseball fans' spirits. Plus, Greg bids farewell to the late, great {artist: Bill Withers}.

## Review: The Strokes

{artist: The Strokes} are back with their sixth album, {album: The New Abnormal}. They first broke out of the {place: New York} scene in 2001 with their debut {album: Is This It}. Since then, the band has put out records over the years, but none reaching the heights of the first. {host: Greg} thinks there are tracks on The New Abnormal that fit right in with the band's catalogue, but feels that its identity is indistinguishable from frontman's Julian Casablancas. {host: Jim} cares for this record even less, finding the lyrics to be contrived and not thinking The Strokes have anything new to offer.

## Review: The Weeknd

{artist: The Weeknd}'s latest album, {album: After Hours}, is his fourth studio record. On After Hours, he mixes the claustrophobic, frantic sounds of his early catalogue with the {genre: R&B} grooves of his more recent music. {host: Greg} finds the album to be a great blend of these elements, and perhaps even the soundtrack to these isolated times. While more innocuous tracks like "{track: Blinding Lights}" provide an {era: '80s} dance party vibe, throughout much of the rest of the album, The Weeknd explores much darker themes of loneliness, drug use and self-destructive behavior. {host: Jim} agrees that there's something darkly intriguing about this artist. While he found the record to be a worthwhile listen, he comes to the conclusion that The Weeknd doesn't much like anyone, least of all himself. 

## Review: Fiona Apple

{artist: Fiona Apple} recently released {album: Fetch the Bolt Cutters}, her first new album in eight years. The title comes from a phrase uttered by Gillian Anderson, who plays the main character in the British detective series The Fall. With this new record, Apple is channeling her inner DIY self, with a homemade sound throughout that features her dogs barking. {host: Jim} applauds Fiona for being open and vulnerable on this record, and thinks that long-time fans will love it. {host: Greg} is more enthusiastic, noting that her innovation and percussive vocal riffs drive the record. He thinks it's a masterpiece.

## Review: Shabazz Palaces

{album: The Don of Diamond Dreams} is the fifth album from {genre: hip hop} duo {artist: Shabazz Palaces}. The vaunted status of {name: Ishmael Butler}'s previous group, {artist: Digable Planets}, and Shabazz Palaces' 2011 debut, {album: Black Up}, place high expectations on this record for {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. Ultimately, Greg is less impressed with this effort than Jim, who vibes with the trippy ending section of the album.

## Review: Lucinda Williams

With {album: Good Souls Better Angels}, {artist: Lucinda Williams} has won over even {host: Jim DeRogatis}, who hails it as a {genre: punk rock} record. "Williams is mad as hell and she's not going to take it anymore," he says in this review. {host: Greg} agrees, citing the biting lyrics in "{track: Man Without A Soul}" and "{track: Wakin' Up}" among others and the "edge guitar" of {name: Stuart Mathis}. Both are unabashed in their praise.

## Interview: Josh Kantor

{name: Josh Kantor} is a keyboardist who often pops up on stage alongside members of {artist: R.E.M.}, {artist: Steve Wynn} or sitting in with the likes of {artist: Wilco} or {artist: Drive-By Truckers}, but his most high-profile gig is as organist for {tag: Boston Red Sox} home games at {place: Fenway Park}. Years ago on a lark, he offered to play requests on the organ during games. Once opening day came and went this year with no baseball, Kantor and his wife found a way to keep playing requests from their home. Now their [Seventh Inning Stretch Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/7thinningstretch2020) is a daily gathering place for music-loving baseball fans around the world. Our producer Andrew Gill spoke with Kantor about this unexpected new outlet for the musician.

## Obit: Bill Withers

{host: Greg} pays respects to {artist: Bill Withers}, who recently died of a heart attack at the age of 81. He recommends revisiting Withers's work beginning with {album: Live at Carnegie Hall} from 1973. The version of "{track: Lean On Me}" from that record shows the dynamism of Withers' in a live setting. A more in depth tribute is in the works for a Sound Opinions episode sometime later this year.
