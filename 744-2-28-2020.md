Jim and Greg continue answering listener questions this week! Listen to [part one here](https://soundopinions.org/show/742).

- Kim: "Have you ever been in a major fight over a musical disagreement? (If yes, DETAILS!)"
- Daniel Bass: "How do you feel that being in Chicago, rather than music industry hubs like New York, LA or Nashville, affects the show."
- Raquel: "Could you please talk about T.V. series and their soundtracks? Not the old ones, but what we're currently viewing. How does pop music contribute to the narrative, etc.?"
- Dan LoPresti: "What are the origins of the Eno bell? Explain the Brian Eno ding. I know Eno at a general level. Is the ding a name-dropping thing?"
- Ben Gart: "Have you ever talked about your own adventures in creating and performing music?"
