## 00:01:00 List: Buried Treasures

{host: Jim} was reminded of {artist: Ian Dury & The Blockheads} for the first time in years by watching the television adaptation of Tana French's {tag: Dublin Murders} stories. Dury's 1978 song, "{track: Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick}" was used, sending our fearless host down a rabbit hole recalling Dury's other two hits "{track: Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll}" and "{track: Reasons To Be Cheerful, Part 3}." Jim makes the case that Dury was more than a novelty act, merging {genre: dance music} with {genre: punk} through his irrepressible attitude.
