Singer-songwriter {artist: John Prine} died April 7 of complications from COVID-19. 
He was 73. 

Born and raised just outside of {place: Chicago}, Prine began his career as a mailman and started writing folk songs along his route. He performed them live in the Chicago {genre: folk} scene alongside friends like {artist: Steve Goodman} and was catapulted to fame after {name: Roger Ebert}, {artist: Paul Anka} and {artist: Kris Kristofferson} became fans. 

While he put out great releases in the {era: '70s}, record companies often didn't know what to do with him - he was a talented songwriter and a gregarious performer, but he just didn't fit the rock mold at the time. Prine started his own label {label: Oh Boy Records} in 1984 and remained independent ever after. Over time, Prine managed to get better at his craft while also having to overcome two bouts with cancer, which altered his singing and speaking voice, making it deeper and more gravelly. 

His last album, {album: The Tree of Forgiveness}, was the best-selling album of his lifetime.
