## 00:01:00 Feature: OutKast's Stankonia
For their fourth album, Atlanta {genre: hip-hop} trailblazers {artist: OutKast} threw out the rulebook. They'd just purchased {artist: Bobby Brown}'s former studio and christened it "{album: Stankonia}" in a nod to a sci-fi poster that had adorned {artist: Andre 3000}'s childhood bedroom wall. Their sense of freedom influenced the production, songwriting and lyrical themes on the album they named for the studio. {host: Greg} says it expresses the complexity of what it meant to be black and living in America at that time. {host: Jim} is impressed at the empathy expressed in the lyrics and the nods to {artist: Parliament} and {artist: Funkadelic} in the music. Greg also points out the embrace of {genre: electronic dance music} pushing the bpm into previously uncharted territory for hip-hop. 

The influence of this album can't be understated. Jim and Greg chart it from {artist: Kendrick Lamar} to {artist: Beyoncé} to {artist: The Weeknd} to {artist: Migos} to {artist: Frank Ocean}.
